# Sound Explored

To begin we need to establish what sound is.

The most important aspect of sound is that it is a vibration and that it has to travle through a medium (be it water, air, etc) in order to be perceived. The medium is also a crucial part in the perception of sound. Without that medium, you wouldn't ever be able to process the sound. Hence why outer space is silent. There is no medium for the vibration to travel through.

Sound is measured in Waves

Waves are measured by:
* [Amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude), described in [Decibel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) (dB)
* [Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency), described in [Hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (Hz)

```The higher the frequency, the faster the particles are vibrating back and forth. And the higher the amplitude, the more energy the sound wave is carrying.```
> For an easy vizualization of a sound wave: If you think of a sound wave as the ocean, the frequency of the wave would be how fast each wave is coming in, and the amplitude would be the size of each of the waves.

Now that we have a basis for what sound is, we can start looking into how humans perceive sound.
Here is an excellent video describing what we'll be looking at:
[The 4 ways sound affects us](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us/up-next?language=en) (4:59)

As stated in the video, there are 4 major ways that sound effects us.

1. [Physiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology)
2. [Psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology)
3. [Cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition)
4. [Behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior)

# Physiologically

The first is physiologically. Sound affects our bodies. Your body is 70% water. Sound travels well in water, so we’re very good conductors of sound. It’s not surprising that sound has a powerful effect on us. Hearing is your primary warning sense, just like every animal on the planet. Do you know there are no deaf vertebrates? There are plenty of vertebrates who don’t see very well at all or not at all, but the hearing is a universal sense, as Seth Horowitz calls it.

# Psychologically

The second way sound affects us is psychologically. It changes our emotions and our moods. Music will do that, of course. I’m sure you can think of a song that will make you happy.

# Cognitively

Thirdly sound affects us cognitively. How well you work is very dependent on the sound around you. Your kids may tell you that they do their homework much better with loud music playing. It’s not true unfortunately. The loud music is probably taking up critical audio bandwidth and they’re not able to hear that internal voice so well. They may do their homework for longer so you may get a better result, but they’re not doing more work per minute. 

# Behaviorally

The final way sound affects us is behaviourally. We will tend to move away from unpleasant sound if we can and even gravitate towards pleasant sounds. Sound can cause stress in us and make us behave negatively. It makes us less sociable, less helpful and less approachable if we’re in a noisy setting.

Now we're starting to get somewhere with how impactful sound actually is on us. It's not only affecting us mentally, but physically as well, with the production of chemicals in our brains and how we respond to the world around us. Through advertisements [like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE9nLWFZ6ac) (11:35) all the way to movies [like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpW_cvkEnk) (2:08). Sound is effecting us at all times of our lives and people tend to forget about it sometimes.

[Audio Branding](https://audio-branding-academy.org/knowledge/what-is-audio-branding/) describes the process of brand development and brand management by use of audible elements within the framework of brand communication. It is part of multi-sensory brand communication and holistic brand design. Audio Branding aims at building solidly a brand sound that represents the identity and values of a brand in a distinctive manner. The audio logo, branded functional sounds, brand music or the brand voice are characteristic elements of Audio Branding.

[“Sonic branding”](https://www.adweek.com/digital/what-is-sonic-branding/) sounds like a complex concept, and it is a relatively unexplored aspect of the PR/marketing world–but it surrounds us every day. Think about sounds or jingles that you associate with brands. Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QymLzVtbsBo) of one being made (1:53). This is levels of thought that go into these things that are all around us.

That’s sonic branding in action.

The power of music and sound transcends language, culture and all things visual, which makes sonic branding a huge part of the promotional game for many companies. For example, anyone anywhere in the world can hear the simple tune “I’m Lovin’ It” and instantly think of McDonald’s (in fact, Justin Timberlake wrote a track around the original five-note jingle). The process of “distilling a multimillion dollar brand into a few seconds of sound” can be long and challenging, but it pays off–sonic branding signatures can be more recognizable than company logos or spokespeople.

Both sonic branding and audio branding play into a new rising force in branding, engagement marketing. Compnaies want consumers to feel that they are a part of the brand, and not just experiencing one.

[Engagement marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement_marketing), sometimes called "Guerilla Marketing" "experiential marketing", "event marketing", "on-ground marketing", "live marketing", "participation marketing", or "special events" is a marketing strategy that directly engages consumers and invites and encourages them to participate in the evolution of a brand or a brand experience. Rather than looking at consumers as passive receivers of messages, engagement marketers believe that consumers should be actively involved in the production and co-creation of marketing programs, developing a relationship with the brand.

### One of the driving forces is information technology

Nowadays business is increasingly driven by information technology. The infonnation revolution will not mean merely an improvement in speed, as suggested by the original metaphor of the "information superhighway." It will mean a transfonnation in media - from print to voice, from sight to sound. It is Quite conceivable that, within a few years, consumers will be working with considerably smaller-and cheaper- computing devices that will integrate mobile phones, television, voice-operated computer with access to anyone and anything-real or virtual - anywhere in the world. Futurists like Dertouzos (1997) predict that within a few years we willsee products like the "bodynet," a web of integrated devices - functioning as cellphone, computer, television, camera, etc. - that will be confined to an invisible envelope around our bodies. This device-or a similar one - will allow people and companies to connect and to share an experiential universe with one another at any time.

Almost every major company in the world uses audio branding and sonic branding to engage in engagement branding. Which means that when you're ar work, your experiencing sounds, while driving with the radio on, or even off, your being affected by sounds, when you're wathcing tv, youtube, netflix, or any other type of media, your also being affected by sounds. Whether you notice it or not, our entire lives are influenced by sounds. Even before we are born we are seen with ultrasound. With the ever evolving information technology field, we have the power to shape the world and reach people we might never have been able to.
