# Sound Explored

To begin we need to establish what sound is.

The most important aspect of sound is that it is a vibration and that it has to travle through a medium (be it water, air, etc) in order to be perceived. The medium is also a crucial part in the perception of sound. Without that medium, you wouldn't ever be able to process the sound. Hence why outer space is silent. There is no medium for the vibrtion to travel through.

Sound is measured in Waves
Waves are measured by:
* Amplitude, described in Decibals (dB)
* Frequency, described in Hertz
```The higher the frequency, the faster the particles are vibrating back and forth. And the higher the amplitude, the more energy the sound wave is carrying.```
> For an easy vizualization of a sound wave: If you think of a sound wave as the ocean, the frequency of the wave would be how fast each wave is coming in, and the amplitude would be the size of each of the waves.

Now that we have a basis for what sound is, we can start looking into how humans perceive sound.
Here is an excellent video describing what we'll be looking at:
