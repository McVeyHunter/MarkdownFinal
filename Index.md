# Sound Explored

To begin we need to establish what sound is.

The most important aspect of sound is that it is a vibration and that it has to travle through a medium (be it water, air, etc) in order to be perceived. The medium is also a crucial part in the perception of sound. Without that medium, you wouldn't ever be able to process the sound. Hence why outer space is silent. There is no medium for the vibrtion to travel through.

Sound is measured in Waves

Waves are measured by:
* [Amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude), described in Decibals (dB)
* [Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency), described in Hertz

```The higher the frequency, the faster the particles are vibrating back and forth. And the higher the amplitude, the more energy the sound wave is carrying.```
> For an easy vizualization of a sound wave: If you think of a sound wave as the ocean, the frequency of the wave would be how fast each wave is coming in, and the amplitude would be the size of each of the waves.

Now that we have a basis for what sound is, we can start looking into how humans perceive sound.
Here is an excellent video describing what we'll be looking at:
[The 4 ways sound affects us](https://www.ted.com/talks/julian_treasure_the_4_ways_sound_affects_us/up-next?language=en) (4:59)

As stated in the video, there are 4 major ways that sound effects us.

1. [Physiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology)
2. [Psychological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology)
3. [Cognitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition)
4. [Behavioral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior)

# Physiologically

The first is physiologically. Sound affects our bodies. Your body is 70% water. Sound travels well in water, so we’re very good conductors of sound. It’s not surprising that sound has a powerful effect on us. Hearing is your primary warning sense, just like every animal on the planet. Do you know there are no deaf vertebrates? There are plenty of vertebrates who don’t see very well at all or not at all, but the hearing is a universal sense, as Seth Horowitz calls it. Incidentally I interview Seth in How to be Heard, and there’s an audio version of that which is available on the website too for those who bought the book.

# Psychologically

The second way sound affects us is psychologically. It changes our emotions and our moods. Music will do that, of course. I’m sure you can think of a song that will make you happy. Maybe you’re thinking of it right now as I speak. I’m thinking of one of my favourite songs, which is Riverman by Nick Drake. It always makes me feel calm and happy.

# Cognitively

Thirdly sound affects us cognitively. How well you work is very dependent on the sound around you. Your kids may tell you that they do their homework much better with loud music playing. It’s not true unfortunately. The loud music is probably taking up critical audio bandwidth and they’re not able to hear that internal voice so well. They may do their homework for longer so you may get a better result, but they’re not doing more work per minute. 

# Behaviorally

The final way sound affects us is behaviourally. We will tend to move away from unpleasant sound if we can and even gravitate towards pleasant sounds. Sound can cause stress us and make us behave negatively. It makes us less sociable, less helpful and less approachable if we’re in a noisy setting.

Now we're starting to get somewhere with how impactful sound actually is on us. It's not only affecting us mentally, but physically as well, with the production of chemicals in our brains and how we respond to the world around us. Through advertisements [like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HE9nLWFZ6ac) (11:35) all the way to movies [like these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcpW_cvkEnk) (2:08). Sound is effecting us at all times of our lives and people tend to forget about it sometimes.

[Audio Branding](https://audio-branding-academy.org/knowledge/what-is-audio-branding/) describes the process of brand development and brand management by use of audible elements within the framework of brand communication. It is part of multi-sensory brand communication and holistic brand design. Audio Branding aims at building solidly a brand sound that represents the identity and values of a brand in a distinctive manner. The audio logo, branded functional sounds, brand music or the brand voice are characteristic elements of Audio Branding.

Almost every major company in the world uses audio branding. Which means that when you're ar work, your experiencing sounds, while driving with the radio on, or even off, your being affected by sounds, when you're wathcing tv, youtube, netflix, or any other type of media, your also being affected by sounds.
